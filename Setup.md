# Skynet Setup Guide

## Prereqs: 
- Visual Studio Code (optional, helps make the installation process easier): https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Node.js installation: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Python installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Postgres installation: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- Homebrew installation (if using macOS): https://brew.sh/
- Golang installation: https://go.dev/doc/install
- Chocolatey installation (if using Windows): https://chocolatey.org/install
- OpenSSL installation
	- macOS: brew install openssl
	- Windows: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html (You may need to add the OpenSSL bin directory to the Windows path environment variable. You can check if it has already been added by typing openssl --version in the command line or PowerShell. By default this should be in C:\Program Files\OpenSSL\bin)
	- Linux: Installed by Default
- Pull Protostar GitHub repository: git pull https://github.com/opendr-io/protostar-web.git
- Neo4j Installation and Sample Data upload:
	1. https://neo4j.com/download/
	2. https://github.com/cyberdyne-ventures/skynet-data
	3. Follow these instructions to get the data uploaded: https://github.com/opendr-io/protostar-data/blob/main/SETUP.md
	3. APOC Plugin installation --> https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/installation/
	4. (Make sure the three steps above this have been completed before doing this step). Copy the Neo4j configuration that came with the repository. Both of these are under the skynet-ai-dev-flask-api folder and move the configuration based on whether or not you need TLS enabled to the conf folder under the directory where the Neo4j instance has been installed. The path to the configurations in the repository are listed below:
 		- Without TLS: skynet-ai-dev-flask-api/baseconfig/neo4j.conf
   		- With TLS: skynet-ai-dev-flask-api/tlsconfig/neo4j.conf

1. If you would like to run the application and have it be accessible across your network, you will need to make changes in the following files in the skynet-react directory.
	- Find what your computerâ€™s hostname is by entering the following into the Terminal, PowerShell, or Command Line: hostname

	- Take the IP and replace the [your_server_hostname] part of the URL in the following files:
		- skynet-react/.env: In this file change the following line VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://[server_hostname]
		- skynet-neo/.env: In this file change the following lines:
  			- VITE_NEO_APP_USERNAME="[neo_username]"
			- VITE_NEO_APP_PASSWORD="[neo_password]"
  			- VITE_NEO_APP_DB_URL="http://[server_hostname]:[port]/db/neo4j"

2.	Before you continue to the next step go to the following files:
	- dbconfig.ini under the skynet-ai-dev-flask-api directory and enter the information for the variables listed in the file.
 		- [Database]
			- HostName=[ip_of_postgres_db]
			- PortNumber=[port_where_postgres_is_running_from]
			- DatabaseName=protostar
			- RootDatabaseUserName=[postgres_root_user]
			- RootDatabasePassword=[postgres_root_password]
			- ApplicationUser=[The_first_user_of_application]
			- ApplicationUserPassword=[Password_of_the_first_user_of_application]

	- Go to the agentconfig.ini under skynet-ai-dev-flask-api directory and enter your API key for one of the LLM providers. Here are the options:
		- [Anthropic]
			- ModelName=
			- AnthropicKey=
			
		- [OpenAI]
			- ModelName=
			- OpenAIKey=

		- [LMStudio]
			- ModelName=
			- LMStudio=NotRequired

		- [Perplexity]
			- ModelName=
			- PerplexityKey=

3. If you would like setup TLS set the following flag to true in the secureconfig.ini file.
	- [General]
		- TLS=True

4. In the secureconfig.ini file under the root directory set the directories where Neo4j and Postgres config files are stored. This is typically under their installation directories. If you set TLS to true in the step 4 go to the secureconfig.ini in the top directory and enter the path for where Neo4j stores its TLS certificates. There should be an https directory under certificates and if not create a new folder called https under certificates wherever Neo4j configurations are stored. In Postgres, the certificates are stored in the data directory where the configurations are stored.

		- [Neo4j]
			- Neo4jCertificatePath=""
			- Neo4jConfigPath=""

		- [Postgres]
			- PostgresVersion=
			- PostgresCertificatePath=""
			- PostgresConfigPath=""

5.	Once you have completed steps above, run the following command in the root directory:
	- sudo python startup.py: macOS or Linux
	- python startup.py: make sure PowerShell is in Administrator mode.
	- (Only if TLS is enabled) You may need to enter your password to apply certificates to Neo4j. On Windows instead of a password a popup will ask if you would like to have the certificates applied.
	- Restart Neo4j from Neo4j Desktop or terminal so that it will use the configurations placed in the conf folder and the TLS certificates (if you enabled TLS).
